**Headline:** 🚀 Breaking Limits: From Raw Data to AI-Powered Insights in < 1 Minute!

**Post Body:**

This week on our Data Science & AI journey, we tackled the ultimate **Full-Stack Data Challenge**! 💻📊

We built a custom web application that not only visualizes data but *understands* it. 

🔥 **What we built:**
✅ **Automated Dashboard**: 10 different chart types generated instantly (Python/Seaborn).
✅ **Gamified Experience**: A dynamic scoring system (Aiming for that 100/100!).
✅ **AI Integration**: Connected Google Gemini API to interpret complex datasets automatically.
✅ **Audio Insights**: Integrated Google NotebookLM's Audio Overview for on-the-go data briefing.

Understanding data is good. Having an AI explain it to you while you look at premium visualizations is *game-changing*.

## 3. System Prompt for Google AI Studio

**Use this prompt when connecting your data summary to the model:**

```text
**Role**: You are a Senior Data Scientist and specialized Data Analyst.

**Context**: I will provide you with a statistical summary (describe()) of a dataset and potentially a description of the columns.

**Task**: 
1. Identify the top 3 most significant trends or outliers in the data.
2. Explain what these trends might imply in a real-world context.
3. Suggest 2 further questions we should ask this data.

**Tone**: Professional, insightful, yet accessible to a non-technical stakeholder.
